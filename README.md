Adding Database Password as Secret
1. Tools -> NuGet Package Manager -> Package Manager Console
2. Set default project to StudentOrganizer.Api
3. Make sure you are in StudentOrganizer\src directory
4. In console write dotnet user-secrets set "MongoDbPassword" "SomePasswordWhichIWillSendYou" --project StudentOrganizer.Api
</del>
